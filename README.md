## Built With
node js React npm JSX

## Getting Started
node js

## Prerequisites
Node.js -- (https://nodejs.org/en/)
Code editor

## Installing
1. Download project with git clone
2. npm install
3. killall node if necessary
4.npm run server on one terminal
5.npm run client on one terminal

## Setup
- All data is stored in an array on the server.
- Running the server code requires nodemon. If you don't already have nodemon, install it globally with npm install nodemon --global.
- npm install npm run server
- Now that the server is running, open a new terminal tab with cmd + t and start the react client app.
- npm run client
- Between the server and client, you'll need two terminal tabs! Because we're using nodemon, both our client side and server side will automatically spin back up when changes are made!
